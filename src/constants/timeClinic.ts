      `Psycholinguists - people who study the influence of language on people's behavior are sure that language determines our character. And life determines language, for example, in the language of northern peoples there are more than 30 words for snow, in southern countries one. Some languages do not know the word no, in other languages there is no ‚ÄúI‚Äù and it determines the worldview. The name of time in different languages can also tell a lot. `,
      `For example, English time - goes back to Old English ‚Äútƒ´ma‚Äù, which is etymologically related to tƒ´d. This word meant not only ‚Äútime‚Äù but also ‚Äútide‚Äù and ‚Äúebb‚Äù (modern tide). English time has a peculiarity: it can denote both an interval and a point in time, when in other languages there are separate names for these concepts. `,
      `Slavonic ‚Äútime‚Äù is borrowed from Church Slavonic. This word is related to the ancient Indian word ‚Äúv√°rtma‚Äù - track. The verb ‚Äúto spin‚Äù is related to the same root! Perhaps that is why Slavic peoples have an attitude to time as something fatal - unambiguous. `,
      `In Chinese, time is Êó∂Èó¥ (shijian). The main meaning of the word is concentrated in the first character Êó∂ (shi). It is formed from two parts - ‚Äúsun‚Äù and ‚Äúto guide‚Äù (Êó• and ‰πã). That is, it symbolizes the movement of the sun, which is time in the earthly sense. Its meaning is ‚Äútime, hour, season, epoch‚Äù. `,
      `The second character Èó¥ (jian) in the word ‚Äútime‚Äù is more of a service character. It means ‚Äúgap, gap, distance.‚Äù This character consists of two parts - the gate (ÈñÄ), and in it the moon (Êúà). It turns out that etymologically the word time means ‚Äúinterval of time‚Äù, not the concept of ‚Äútime‚Äù as such. That is, for the Chinese, time is necessarily from something and to something, some distance measured in hours. In Arabic, time was originally denoted by the word ‚Äúalmanac‚Äù, which was borrowed by many languages of the world in the original meaning of guide, table, overview. The modern concept of the word ‚Äútime‚Äù ÿßŸÑŸàŸÇÿ™ is close to the Slavic understanding of time - a form of being, the best moment for something`,

Therefore, in order to rationalize the use of time, the Roman Empire first came up with the idea of dividing the day into equal hours.

Focusing on 30 parts, where each conditional hour is less, and your sense of time does not know about it and is oriented simply on the dial, you will more effectively prioritize rest-employment. One of the most effective time management tools is considered to be the splitting of a large task. This method is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúeating the elephant in pieces.‚Äù The idea is to divide a large task into smaller ones. ‚ÄúPortionally‚Äù you can cope with any task, it no longer seems insurmountable.

It takes 4 of these cycles of work and rest to take a major 30-minute break. In 2009, Stanford University researchers conducted an experiment in which they found out that if a person performs several intellectual tasks at the same time, he is worse at concentrating, thinking and memorizing. It is much more effective to allocate one task in one period of time, and concentrate only on it. The exception is the combination of physical and mental activity."]

It occurs when, when you ‚Äúsuddenly‚Äù look at a watch with hands, the second hand seems to freeze for a second and then continues moving.  The reasons are not completely known, but there is a good explanation for this magic. When we look at anything, the eye is in constant movement over microscopic distances. These movements are called saccades. The saccades allow the brightness of individual points to shift constantly, so the picture is stable. Information from the eyes comes to the brain for processing, and the brain already transmits the processed result to the consciousness. When we look at one point, the picture stabilizes. But when we quickly transfer our gaze, the brain first receives a blurred picture, so the processing and sending of all this business to the consciousness is suspended until the gaze is not fixed on the point to which it was directed. After that, the transmission of data to consciousness is restored. But what to do with that segment of time when the eye was moving? Everything is simple - this segment is filled with the initial picture from the moment when the eye focuses on a new object, and it is perceived as a longer fragment of a new scene. The same is true for touch. If you grab an object sharply, the time of interaction with it will be perceived as longer than it really is. "]

Why does the human's own clock, which appeared as an adaptation to daily changes in the external environment, have a period different from 24 hours? From the point of view of evolution, this is a clear paradox.

30H is convenient for adventurers and dreamers who feel the pressure of living in a 24-hour system.
Time is a top-secret account opened by God in your Name. Own time is the only personal account you will never get to know anything about. `,
  `How much did the Supreme creator gift you? How much is left?
The only we can do is manage "expenses". Don't let the time run out and reduce your life account to null ahead of time! After all, life is measured in deeds, not in hours. `,
  `We collected 12 minutes from each hour and got an additional 6 "hours" of life! The dial of each model is divided into 30 parts. The concept does not cancel but makes it possible to redistribute time during the day more efficiently. 
30H is not just a watch, but a time management technique that helps to correctly redistribute time without exposing the body to stress.`,
  `We never know where we are wasting time. Crises and inflation are killing business.  Time is an uncontrollable inflation of life.  30h ‚Äìwith a wise approach, it will become your 3rd hand.
30H is like a pizza. It can be divided into 6 parts, 8 or 10. The diameter does not change but you can feed more people without any waste.`,
  `30H is like a sandglass.  There is a strict number of grains of sand inside and they fall at the right speed, because the narrow neck. We didn't change the number of grains we narrowed the neck.`,
  `30H is like a jar. There are big stones, small ones, and sand ‚Äî these are deeds of your life. Imagine if you put sand first, then small, and then large stones - how much will fit? But if to do it the other way - may fit much more.
The same way the watch divided into 30 parts works - redistribute time to make room for something necessary.`,
